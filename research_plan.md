# Research Plan

## Research Idea

[Describe the core research idea. What gap in the literature does this address? Why is it important?]

## Research Question

[State the primary research question(s) clearly and concisely.]

## Theoretical Framework

[Outline the theoretical basis for the study. What existing theories or models inform the hypotheses?]

## Design

[Describe the experimental/study design: between/within-subject, number of treatments, randomisation strategy, etc.]

## Hypotheses

[List pre-registered or planned hypotheses with expected directions.]

- H1:
- H2:
- H3:
- H4:

## Variables

### Independent Variables

[List and define treatment/independent variables.]

### Dependent Variables

[List and define outcome/dependent variables and how they are measured.]

### Controls

[List any control variables or covariates.]

## Sample

[Describe the target population, recruitment strategy, sample size, and any power calculations.]

## Analysis Strategy

[Outline the planned statistical approach: primary tests, robustness checks, exploratory analyses.]

## Timeline

This section tracks what has been done and what remains. **Claude must update this table whenever a task is completed or a new task is identified.** Mark completed items with the date they were finished. Add new rows as the project evolves.

| Phase                | Target Date | Status    | Date Done  | Notes                        |

### How to update this timeline

- When a task is **completed**, set its Status to `Done` and fill in the Date Done column.
- When a task is **in progress**, set its Status to `In progress`.
- When a task is **blocked** by something, set its Status to `Blocked` and explain in Notes.
- When new tasks emerge during the work, **add new rows** to the table.
- If a phase needs to be broken into sub-tasks, indent them beneath the parent phase.

## Notes for Future Agents

This section collects hard-won lessons, gotchas, and institutional knowledge that a future agent needs when picking up the next stage of this research. Add to this section whenever you learn something that isn't obvious from the code or context files alone.

Each entry should include a date and a short description of the lesson.

| Date | Lesson |
|------|--------|
|      |        |
