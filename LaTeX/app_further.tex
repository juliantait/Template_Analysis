\section{Further Analyses}\label{app:further}

% This appendix documents analyses that we investigated during the project but
% which ultimately turned out not to be relevant for the paper. They are
% included here for completeness and transparency, and are available upon
% request. Each subsection briefly addresses one analysis: what we looked at,
% why it seemed interesting, and why it did not make it into the main text or
% standard appendix.
%
% Corresponding code lives in Scripts/Further Analysis/further_analysis.R.
% Output follows the standard naming convention with a "further_" prefix.

% \subsection{[Descriptive title]}
%
% [One paragraph. First sentence: what we investigated and why it appeared
% interesting on the face of it. Middle: what the analysis showed. Final
% sentence: why this turned out not to be relevant for the paper — e.g. the
% effect was small, the pattern was driven by a confound, the result did not
% survive a basic specification check, or the question was tangential to the
% core argument.]
