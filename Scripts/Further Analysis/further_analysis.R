# =============================================================================
# FURTHER ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Analyses that are interesting to us as researchers but DO NOT
# appear in the main paper or standard appendix.
#
# Everything here was worth investigating — it looked promising or
# informative — but ultimately turned out not to be relevant for the
# manuscript. Each analysis in this script should have a corresponding
# subsection in LaTeX/app_further.tex with a brief paragraph explaining:
#   1. What we looked at and why it seemed interesting
#   2. What we found
#   3. Why it turned out not to be relevant for the paper
#
# This appendix is "available upon request" and exists for our own records
# and for referees who may ask about additional checks.
#
# Commented out in main.R by default. Uncomment to regenerate output.
# Output: Graphs to Graphs/, Tables to Tables/
